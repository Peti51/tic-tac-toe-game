For the project, I chose React as the primary technology due to its component-based development approach, which enables breaking down the web application into separate reusable components. This results in more modular and maintainable code, making development easier and efficient.

To handle user input and data submission, I implemented Forms, allowing seamless interaction with the application.

For managing navigation and rendering different pages, I utilized Routers, ensuring smooth transitions between various views within the web application.

To add stateful logic to functional components, I employed React Hooks, enabling dynamic updates and interactions.

To enhance error handling and prevent crashes, I implemented Error Boundaries, ensuring a more robust application.

For displaying interactive modal dialogs or pop-up windows, I integrated Popups into the project, enhancing the user experience.

Finally, I created a dedicated Login Page, providing users with a secure authentication process to access the web application.

By combining these technologies, the project delivers an efficient, flexible, and user-friendly web application with advanced features for seamless user interactions and data management.
